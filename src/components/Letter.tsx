        &#9;Happy birthday silly!!! I made you a little websiteee for your
        birthdayy, I couldn&apos;t think of anything to make or buy, but then I
        remembered, we both code!!! We both do web stuffs! I thought it would be
        cute :P.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#9;Anywayy, I wanted to write you a little letter about how much I
        appreciate you being here and in my life for thisss. You have somehow in
        the couple of months we have talked, managed to make yourself both my
        favorite and most trusted friend ever! Before you, everyone fell off or
        left or was just temporary, I haven&apos;t seen anyone treat me like you
        have. I really mean it when I say you&apos; the best friend ever ever
        ever!!!
      </p>

        &#9;I loved spending all the time coding together with you, I loved
        teaching you python and html stuffs and even our worst enemy, css.
        I&apos;ll never forget the day I literally sat down for 9 HOURS WITH YOU
        to help make python GUI. While you may think that was annoying to me, I
        actually loved spending so much time with you it was nice.
      </p>

        &#9;But you also the only person that does programming related things
        that doesn&apos;t just do programming stuffs then leaveee. I can always
        come to you when I&apos;m sad and need help or super excited and want to
        share something. You have literally carried me through so much since we
        met, and I can&apos;t thank you enough for that.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        &#9;I&apos;m so happy I met you silly, thank you for everything you do
        ðŸ˜­. I hope you like your little birthday website, happy birthday!!!
